Agentforce 360 Platform</strong> This foundation for enterprise-grade AI agents features a conversational builder, hybrid reasoning capabilities for precision and control, and integrated voice technology. The platform now includes Agentforce Builder, a new conversational development studio that lets teams design, test, and deploy agents using natural language with no manual configuration.</p><p><strong>2. Data 360</strong> A unified, trusted data layer providing contextual understanding through innovations like Intelligent Context and Tableau Semantics, which enable agents to access unstructured content like PDFs or diagrams while translating data into business language through semantic data models.</p><p><strong>3. Customer 360 Apps</strong> Business logic and institutional memory applications now brought to life through AI agents that deeply understand every customer and process from the inside out.</p><p><strong>4. Slack Integration</strong> Slack serves as the conversational interface for humans and agents to work together, connecting knowledge, actions, and data in real time, enabling businesses to deploy agents that work across teams and collaborate with humans and other agents directly in Slack.</p><h3><strong>Key Technical Innovations</strong></h3><p><strong>Agent Script &amp; Hybrid Reasoning</strong> Agent Script is a new high-level, human-readable JSON expression language for controlling agents that allows teams to define complex agent logic, including conditionals, "if/then" rules, and hand-offs. The configurable Atlas Reasoning Engine balances the inherent creativity of LLMs with the certainty of structured business logic, ensuring more reliable agent behavior.</p><p><strong>Agentforce Voice</strong> Agentforce Voice delivers natural, human-like conversations that capture a company's unique tone and personality, achieving near-human conversational flow while executing actions like updating CRM records, triggering workflows, or calling APIs, with full auditability through Data 360. The voice layer features low-latency transcription, realistic speech synthesis, and deep Salesforce integration, tested through thousands of real-world scenarios including noisy backgrounds and complex, multi-step processes.</p><h3><strong>Slack as the Agentic Operating System</strong></h3><p>Salesforce announced broader integration between Agentforce and Slack, with core apps including Agentforce Sales, IT, and HR surfacing directly in Slack starting immediately and expanding through early 2026. Slack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot designed as a personalized AI agent that learns about users and offers insights and suggestions.</p><p>Agentforce Sales in Slack puts customer records, notifications, and AI agents in the Slack sidebar alongside team conversations, making pipeline management as simple as conversation. Agentforce IT Service in Slack brings support directly into the platform where employees can get instant help for requests like password resets. Agentforce HR Service in Slack provides quick answers to HR questions without leaving Slack, with seamless handoff to human HR teams when needed.</p><h3><strong>Market Position &amp; Adoption</strong></h3><p>Salesforce reports that Agentforce has 12,000 customers—significantly higher than any of its competitors. Early pilot customers of Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson.</p><p><strong>Real-World Success Metric:</strong> One use case showed 1-800Accountant achieving a 90% case deflection rate during tax week using Agentforce agents that provide real-time customer updates and arm professionals with pre-built agendas.</p><h3><strong>Strategic Partnerships</strong></h3><p>Salesforce and Google announced an expansion of their strategic partnership on October 16, 2025, bringing Google's Gemini models to Agentforce 360. The collaboration integrates Agentforce 360 with Google Workspace for sales and IT service. Salesforce's Atlas Reasoning Engine introduces hybrid reasoning with Gemini models, enabling AI agents to combine the creativity of AI with the precision of structured logic.</p><p>Salesforce has also expanded partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, integrating reasoning models powered by technology from these companies, allowing Salesforce customers to choose which reasoning model powers their agents.</p><hr><h2><strong>SECTION 2: GOOGLE GEMINI 2.5 COMPUTER USE - THE WEB AUTOMATION AGENT</strong></h2><h3><strong>Overview &amp; Release Timeline</strong></h3><p>Google released the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model via the Gemini API, enabling developers to build agents that can interact with user interfaces. The model outperforms others in web and mobile control benchmarks with lower latency.</p><h3><strong>Core Capabilities &amp; How It Works</strong></h3><p>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is a specialized model built on Gemini 2.5 Pro's visual understanding and reasoning capabilities that powers agents capable of interacting with user interfaces (UIs), operating in a loop where the model receives user requests, screenshots of the environment, and history of recent actions, then analyzes these inputs and generates a response typically representing a UI action such as clicking or typing.</p><p>After action execution, a new screenshot of the GUI and the current URL are sent back to the Computer Use model as a function response, restarting the loop until task completion.</p><h3><strong>Performance &amp; Optimization</strong></h3><p>The model is primarily optimized for web browsers but demonstrates strong promise for mobile UI control tasks. It is not yet optimized for desktop OS-level control.</p><p>Google claims the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model "outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile benchmarks" with lower latency, demonstrating competent handling of complex tasks like playing games or browsing websites.</p><h3><strong>Real-World Demonstration Scenarios</strong></h3><p>Google provided two demonstration examples. The first involved extracting pet details from a signup form, adding them as guests to a spa CRM, and setting up an appointment with a specialist for a specific date and time. The second example involved organizing chaotic sticky notes into predefined categories on a web application.</p><h3><strong>Internal Applications</strong></h3><p>Google teams have already deployed the model to production for use cases including UI testing, which can make software development significantly faster. Versions of this model have also powered Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and agentic capabilities in AI Mode in Search.</p><h3><strong>Safety &amp; Governance Framework</strong></h3><p>Google has trained safety features directly into the model to address three key risks: intentional misuse by users, unexpected model behavior, and prompt injections and scams in the web environment. Developers also receive safety controls that empower them to prevent the model from auto-completing potentially high-risk or harmful actions, including actions that could harm system integrity, compromise security, bypass CAPTCHAs, or control medical devices.</p><h3><strong>Access &amp; Pricing</strong></h3><p>The model is available in public preview, accessible via the Gemini API on Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, with developers able to start building using provided reference documentation.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use follows the same token-based billing structure as standard Gemini 2.5 Pro, with input tokens priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, rising to $2.50 per million tokens for longer prompts. The key difference is that while Gemini 2.5 Pro offers a free tier, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not, requiring payment from the outset.</p><hr><h2><strong>SECTION 3: BROADER ENTERPRISE AGENTIC AI ECOSYSTEM</strong></h2><h3><strong>Microsoft's MCP-Powered Security &amp; Discovery</strong></h3><p>Microsoft expanded its Sentinel security platform with new graph capabilities and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling Security Copilot agents to more rapidly investigate and respond to threats while facilitating integration of third-party and internally developed agents.</p><p>Microsoft is delivering broad first-party support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) across its agent platform and frameworks, spanning GitHub, Copilot Studio, Dynamics 365, Azure AI Foundry, Semantic Kernel and Windows 11. Microsoft also introduced Microsoft Discovery, an extensible platform built to empower researchers to transform the discovery process with agentic AI, helping R&amp;D departments accelerate time to market for new products.</p><h3><strong>Industry Reality Check: Gartner's Sobering Forecast</strong></h3><p>According to Gartner (October 7, 2025), the current supply of agentic AI models, platforms and products far exceeds demand, which will result in consolidation and market correction as hype gives way to fundamental economics.</p><p><strong>Projected Cancellation Rates:</strong> Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by the end of 2027 due to escalating costs, unclear business value, or inadequate risk controls. Most agentic AI projects are currently early-stage experiments or proof-of-concepts driven by hype.</p><p><strong>Long-Term Adoption Outlook:</strong> Despite challenges, Gartner predicts at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI by 2028 (up from 0% in 2024), and 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028 (up from less than 1% in 2024).</p><h3><strong>Adoption Risk Warning</strong></h3><p>A recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.</p><hr><h2><strong>SECTION 4: OPEN STANDARDS &amp; INTEROPERABILITY TRENDS</strong></h2><p>Salesforce and Google jointly support open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A), which enable multi-agent collaboration across platforms and specialized domains. This commitment to enterprise-grade AI is strengthened by their support for these standards, which build on Agentforce 360's powerful orchestration capabilities for connecting agents, data, and tools across the enterprise.</p><hr><h2><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR ENTERPRISE ADOPTION</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Platform Consolidation</strong>: Salesforce positioning Slack as the central "agentic OS" while other enterprises build agent platforms around their existing ecosystems</li><li><strong>Model Choice</strong>: Enterprises now have flexibility with Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4 reasoning models powering agent platforms</li><li><strong>Safety-First Design</strong>: Both major releases emphasize built-in safety guardrails alongside developer controls</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Check</strong>: Strong vendor push for agentic AI adoption clashing with Gartner's prediction that 40% of projects will fail by 2027</li><li><strong>Open Standards Emergence</strong>: MCP and A2A protocols enabling multi-agent collaboration across different platforms</li><li><strong>Real ROI Evidence</strong>: Early wins like 1-800Accountant's 90% case deflection rate provide concrete use cases, but broader enterprise success remains uncertain</li></ol><p>This week represents a pivotal moment where major cloud providers are moving from AI agent experimentation to production deployment, while simultaneously market analysts warn of significant adoption challenges ahead.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 17, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://komarayuvakiran.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://komarayuvakiran.github.io/gh-pages/authors/mad/" rel="author">mad</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://komarayuvakiran.github.io/gh-pages/20-latest-ai-updates-this-week/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> 🔥 20 LATEST AI UPDATES THIS WEEK</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://komarayuvakiran.github.io/gh-pages/authors/mad/" class="feed__author">mad</a> <time datetime="2025-10-17T06:54" class="feed__date">October 17, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://komarayuvakiran.github.io/gh-pages/20-latest-ai-updates-this-week/">🔥 20 LATEST AI UPDATES THIS WEEK</a></h3></header><p>Breaking news from OpenAI DevDay, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Amazon, and more October 2025 will be remembered as a turning point in artificial intelligence.
